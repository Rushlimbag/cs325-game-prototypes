<h2>Black Ice</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I decided to attempt simulating ice physics in a game where you have to dodge falling objects.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I added "ice" physics (sliding when stopping), although I could not get sliding to work when changing direction/accelerating.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned about collsion detection and basic movement based physics.
The hardest part of making this prototype was figuring out how to get collision for each ice spike.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Dodge falling ice whilst sliding around.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Ice
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Keyboard, a lot of randomness, achiever, platformer
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
"Ice" physics and collision detection of multiple objects.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
A challenging fight against physics and randomness.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Left and right arrow keys move the player character, though the character will only slowly lose momentum when the player releases a key. Spacebar can be used to jump. The goal is to dodge as many falling ice spikes as possible (until ~200 fall). If the player is hit by a spike it is gameover.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Qucikly strafing left and right will negate some of the momentum.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You play as [PLACEHOLDER], an inquisitive adventurer braving the harsh climes of the arctic circle. While tracking what you believe to be a snow leopard
, you find yourself deep inside an icy crevasse. You must try to survive as the ice around you melts, loosening deadly icicles from high above you.</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who enjoy difficult platformers like IWBTG.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
A few minutes.
</li>

</ul>
