<h2>Black Ice v2</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I decided to attempt simulating ice physics in a game where you have to dodge falling objects.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Ice physics when moving (acceleration and deceleration), game states, menu, ramping difficulty.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned more about the physics engine, how to work with timers, and how to implement game states.
Getting game states to work was the most difficult, especially when trying to delay changing states after an event.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
<a href="https://rushlimbag.github.io/cs325-game-prototypes/Game%204%20trak/">Digital Assignment 4</a>
<ul>
<li>Improved physics (added acceleration and deceleration when changing direction)</li>
<li>Added game states adapting from provided templates to include preloader and main menu</li>
<li>Added increasing difficulty as time progresses in game (more spikes spawn the longer you survive)</li>
<li>Added functionality for returning to main menu after losing/winning</li>
<li>Reduced lag</li>
<li>Cleaned up backgrounds/added new backgrounds</li>
<li>Some work was done on creating a new player spritesheet, but it was not finished in time and thus was not implemented. It is included in the assets folder as 'unused-player'</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Dodge falling ice whilst sliding around.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Ice
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Keyboard, a lot of randomness, achiever, platformer
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Improving ice physics, adding game states, reducing lag.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
A challenging fight against physics and randomness.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Left and right arrow keys move the player character. Spacebar can be used to jump. The goal is to dodge falling spikes until 400 have fallen. More spikes fall as time spent alive increases. If the player is hit by a spike it is gameover. The player is automatically returned to the main menu ~3 seconds after winning/losing.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Qucikly strafing left and right will negate some of the momentum.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You play as Sir Archibald Winsworth, an inquisitive adventurer braving the harsh climes of the arctic circle. While tracking what you believe to be a snow leopard, you find yourself deep inside an icy crevasse. You must try to survive as the ice around you melts, loosening deadly icicles from high above you.</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who enjoy difficult platformers like IWBTG.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
A few minutes.
</li>

</ul>
