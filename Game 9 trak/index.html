<h2>Golden Age v2.0</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Players can click anywhere in a particular cell on the map and change data/the board. There is also adjacency checks internally to keep players from placing flags in cells not adjacent to others of the same type and automatic turn switching.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Checking for adjacency was very difficult until i figured out I could just add a a 'boundary' to my array.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Loading screen: <a href="https://www.xmple.com/wallpaper/black-blue-gradient-linear-800x600-c2-000000-00008b-a-270-f-14-image/">Blue Gradient</a></li>
<li>Loading bar: edited from 'template-gamestate-functional'</li>
<li>All other assets were created by me</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
<li>Analog Assignment: Golden Age</li>
<li>I referenced Ashley Crouch's Weird Checkers prototype for help creating my internal board structure: <a href="https://github.com/ashleycrouch/cs325-game-prototypes/tree/master/weirdcheckersiterate">Weird Checkers</a></li>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
2 players fight for control of territories in a war between kingdoms.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Get a working board with clickable cells to allow addition of rulesets and more sprites. Really just trying to get core functionality done.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should experience a strategic game of war with simple rules and relatively quick playtime.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Each player first picks a spot for their capital: red must place theirs in the top row while blue must place it in the bottom. Players then take turns claiming territory adjacent to already claimed land. Eventually, I will implement unit types and a claim limit with mechanics for conquering enemy territories/capitals.
But for now only basic functionality is implemented.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The title is a reference to Berserk, hopefully you get the idea.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Strategy game fans.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
A few minutes.
</li>

</ul>
